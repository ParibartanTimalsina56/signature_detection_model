# Signature Detection Model

This project focuses on detecting **signatures** in scanned documents or images using state-of-the-art object detection models â€” **YOLOv8s** and **YOLOv10**.

The goal is to compare and analyze the performance of both models on a signature detection task.

## ðŸš€ Models Used

- [YOLOv8s](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) â€” lightweight and fast object detector.
- [YOLOv10](https://github.com/YuTongXu/YOLOv10) â€” latest version with improved accuracy and efficiency.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Train and evaluate **YOLOv8s** and **YOLOv10** on a **signature detection dataset**.
- Compare:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - mAP (mean Average Precision)
  - Inference Speed
- Visualize and analyze results.
